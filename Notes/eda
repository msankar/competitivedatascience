EDA
• get comfortable with the data
• find magic features
Do EDA first. Do not immediately dig into modelling.

Get domain knowledge
– It helps to deeper understand the problem
• Check if the data is intuitive
– And agrees with domain knowledge
• Understand how the data was generated
– As it is crucial to set up a proper validation

Two things to do with anonymized features:
– Try to decode the features
• Guess the true meaning of the feature
– Guess the feature types
• Each type needs its own preprocessing

VISUALIZATIONS
Histograms:
plt.hist(x)
Plot (index versus value):
plt.plot(x, ‘.’)
Statistics:
df.describe()
x.mean()
x.var()
Other tools:
x.value_counts()
x.isnull()

plt.scatter(x1, x2)
pd.scatter_matrix(df)
df.corr(), plt.matshow( … )
df.mean().sort_values().plot(style=’.’)

• Explore individual features
• Histogram
• Plot (index vs value)
• Statistics
• Explore feature relations
• Pairs
− Scatter plot, scatter matrix
− Corrplot
• Groups
− Corrplot + clustering
− Plot (index vs feature statistics)


DATA CLEANUP
train.nunique(axis=1) == 1
traintest.T.drop_duplicates()
for f in categorical_feats:
   traintest[f] =raintest[f].factorize()
   traintest.T.drop_duplicates()
